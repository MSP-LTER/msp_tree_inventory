Description: This package wrangles tree inventory data along with other covariate datasets and creates figures and analyses for Keller et al. Ecological Applications "Tree diversity across the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area in relation to climate and social vulnerability."
00_build_EcoApps.R wrangles the various datasets sets together and calls the other R scripts as needed.
10_calc-species-diversity_EcoApps.R is called by 00_build_EcoApps.R and calculates multiple metrics of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity for the tree inventory dataset.
11_CVI-analysis_EcoApps.R is called by 00_build_EcoApps.R and uses the Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) to calculate urban canopy climate vulnerability for census tracks across the study area.
fcns_MSPtreeinventory.R is called by 00_build_EcoApps.R and includes functions specific to this package.
figs_MS_EcoApps.R makes figures for the Keller et al. 2024 Ecological Applications manuscript. (Note that due to a small subset of the data not being publicly available, the figures will not perfectly match those in the publication).
stats_MS_EcoApps.R carries out the statistical analyses for the Keller et al. 2024 Ecological Applications manuscript. (Note that due to a small subset of the data not being publicly available, the statistics will not perfectly match those in the publication.)
